HOW TO BAKE A CAKE

Ingredients:
- 2 ½ cups (310g) all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk

Instructions:

**Step 1: Prepare the Oven and Pans**
- Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
- Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans (or line them with parchment paper).

**Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients**
- In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

**Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar**
- In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together using a hand or stand mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

**Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla**
- Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
- Stir in the vanilla extract.

**Step 5: Incorporate Dry Ingredients and Milk**
- Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients in three parts, alternating with the milk in two parts.
  - Start with the dry ingredients.
  - Add half the milk.
  - Add more dry ingredients.
  - Pour in the remaining milk.
  - Finish with the dry ingredients.
- Mix until just combined—do not overmix!

**Step 6: Bake the Cake**
- Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
- Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

**Step 7: Cool the Cake**
- Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes.
- Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.

**Step 8: Frost and Serve**
- Frost with your favorite frosting (vanilla buttercream, chocolate, or cream cheese).
- Slice and enjoy your homemade cake!
